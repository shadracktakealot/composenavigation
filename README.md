# Jetpack Compose Navigation Options

## [Navigation Compose (Google)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)

The Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications. You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation component's infrastructure and features.

## [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master)

Decompose is a Kotlin Multiplatform library for breaking down your code into tree-structured lifecycle-aware business logic components (aka BLoC), with routing functionality and pluggable UI (Jetpack/Multiplatform Compose, Android Views, SwiftUI, Kotlin/React, etc.).

>See code example [here](app/src/main/java/com/takealot/composenav/decompose)

## [Voyager](https://github.com/adrielcafe/voyager)

A multiplatform navigation library built for, and seamlessly integrated with, Jetpack Compose.

>See code example [here](app/src/main/java/com/takealot/composenav/voyager)

## [Compose Destinations]()

A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose Navigation under the hood. It hides the complex, non-type-safe and boilerplate code you would have to write otherwise.
No need to learn a whole new framework to navigate - most APIs are either the same as with the Jetpack Components or inspired by them.
